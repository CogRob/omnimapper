This is the Demo image for the Omnimapper project

[OmniMapper](https://github.com/CognitiveRobotics/omnimapper) is an open source SLAM and mapping library and framework developed by the [Cognitive Robotics Lab](http://cogrob.org) within the [Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines](http://www.robotics.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu). 

The mapping library aims to support a wide array of mapping tasks, ranging from scan matching based pose graphs to 3D feature-based maps annotated with semantic information. It has been designed with modularity in mind, so as to provide solutions to multi-modal mapping problems with any sensors that may be available. This can range from a single handheld Kinect to a robot that includes odometric information, kinect, and laser range finders.
